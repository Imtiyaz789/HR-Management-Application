        summary: `To be able to pay and send your application, every section must be ticked as complete. If you're applying independently, that includes your referee submitting their reference online.
        If the payment isn't going through, please double check all details have been entered correctly, you have funds available, and the card has been registered for online payments. If you're outside of the UK, you may need to let your bank know you're trying to make the payment as well.
Please avoid clicking multiple times as this can also cause problems. If it locks your payment attempts, this will reset automatically after two minutes.`

        text : "How do I know what to charge?",
        summary : `The right price for everything is easily defined. It's the maximum amount the customer is willing to pay for it. A good starting point is to look at how much your target customers are paying for alternatives to your product or service.
        The first step is to pull together a representative selection of competitive and comparable products or services, and to prepare a list of all the features offered by each package. Few customers buy the product alone. People buy a package and this includes aspects such as: the brand name, personal service, quality, flexibility, reputation, range of options, location, delivery options, easy parking, technical advice and many other factors. A £3,000 used car from a small garage could be worth £4,000 from a bigger dealer.  
        The next step is to make an objective comparison, using these features lists, to help establish relative values to the customer. It is essential to be clear about what exactly you are selling compared with your competitors. Finally, ask people from outside the company for their opinions.`

    {
        text : "What should the relationship be between price and costs?",
        summary : `There is no relationship. Costs are facts and must be fully understood and managed. Prices are policy and have to be decided.
        Customers know the value of what you are selling from their understanding of what is being offered elsewhere. You have to bolster the attractiveness of your offer with a clear presentation of features and benefits and set your price. If you have got it right, your price confirms the customer's evaluation and you may well make the sale. If your price is too high, the customer will get better value elsewhere. If your price is too low (as is often the case with smaller businesses), the customer may still buy elsewhere, for peace of mind.
        If you generate huge gross margins, don't be embarrassed - you probably need the money to cover promotion and selling costs. If your gross margin is too small, you will have to either find a way of cutting costs or stop selling this product or service.`
